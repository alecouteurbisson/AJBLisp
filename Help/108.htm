<b>Function </b><br />
<p>
Open/close the session log file.  The file is specified
by the path string argument. The optional &lt;createflag&gt;
argument forces the log-file to be flushed if non-nil. If
absent or nil then any existing log-file will be appended
to.  If no arguments are passed then the logfile will be
closed if it was open.
</p><p>
Whenever a log-file is opened or
closed then a comment is inserted in the log so that
multiple sessions can be kept distinct.  logfile returns
a boolean which is t on success.
</p><p>
Note that the log-file
will fail to open if it is already open but it may be
closed without error whether it is open or not.
