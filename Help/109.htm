<h1><br /> (load &lt;file&gt; [&lt;verbose&gt;])</h1>
<b>Function </b><br />
<p>
Load and evaluate expressions from a file.  If the verbose
option is present and not nil then print the value of each
expression read.
</p><p>
The file name can be given as a string or a file atom can be
used.  If a file name is given then the file is always closed
after use. A boolean is returned which is t if the file opened
correctly.  An open file, given as a file atom, will be read
from the current file pointer on entry.  Use file-position to
adjust this if necessary. Errors ocurring when evaluating the
expressions in the file are handled in the normal way.
</p><p>
If a named file cannot be found then the following variations
will be tried in sequence and the first that resolves to a real
file will be used.
<pre>
 &lt;file&gt;.lsp
 %LISPPATH%&lt;file&gt;
 %LISPPATH%&lt;file&gt;.lsp
</p><p>
</pre>
Note: No special consideration is taken to avoid invalid
filenames since these will always fail-safe anyway.
</p><p>
E.g. "%LISPPATH%C:\fred.lsp" might be tried but will just
fail without incident
<p>
<br /><br /><b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
&gt; (load "answer to life the universe and everything")
42   ; Assumes file exists and can be located
= t  ; File opened OK
</pre>
</body>
</html>
