<h1><br /> (and [&lt;boolean&gt; ...])</h1>
<b>Macro    </b><br />
<p>
Evaluates its arguments from left to right until
one of them is nil whereupon it returns nil.
If all arguments are not nil or if there are no arguments
then it returns t.
</p><p>
In addition to its use as a boolean operator it can also
be used to check pre-conditions (although when/unless are
better suited for this purpose.)
<p>
<br /><br /><b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
&gt; (and)                  ; Degenerate case
= t

&gt; (and t nil)
= nil

&gt; (and (consp x) (pop x))
= nil                     ; x was not a cons so (pop x)
                          ; was never evaluated
