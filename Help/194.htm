<h1><br /> (cond (&lt;pred&gt;  [&lt;action&gt; ...]) ...)</h1>
<b>Macro    </b><br />
<p>
Takes any number of arguments, each of which is a list.
The car of each list is evaluated, in turn, until one
evaluates non-nil.  The actions which form the cdr of
that list are then evaluated in order and the value of
the last action returned.
</p><p>
If no list is selected, the selected list has no actions
or the entire cond has no arguments, then nil is returned.
The last condition in a cond is often t as a catch-all
for everything that has fallen through the prior cases.
</p><p>
No arguments are evaluated unless it is expressly stated
so above.
<p>
<br /><br /><b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
&gt; (cond)                         ; Degenerate case
= nil

&gt; (cond ((atom x) 'atom)
        ((listp x) 'list)
        (t 'not_atom_or_list) )
= atom                           ; So x was an atom
