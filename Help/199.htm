<h1><br /> (while &lt;cond&gt; &lt;body&gt; ...)</h1>
<b>Macro    </b><br />
<p>
If &lt;cond&gt; is nil then evaluate the expressions in &lt;body&gt;
in turn, returning the last.  If &lt;body&gt;... is omitted then
return the value of &lt;cond&gt;, always nil.
In addition, the next time that control returns to the top
level of a loop function then the loop will exit with the
entire value of the expression that halted it as the result.
</p><p>
It is intended that until only be used at the top-level
of a loop and in this case the operation is obvious.
</p><p>
For/foreach loops will also exit but the return value is
discarded
