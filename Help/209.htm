<h1><br /> (guard &lt;body&gt;... &lt;cleanup&gt;)</h1>
<b>Macro    </b><br />
<p>
Guard functions just like progn except that the last
expression in a guard is always executed.
If any form of non-local exit from &lt;body&gt;
occurs then the final &lt;cleanup&gt; form will be executed
before control leaves the guard.
</p><p>
Exceptions occurring in the cleanup expression are not
affected.  Errors will still be reported and guard will
not return if an error occurs in any of the expressions.
<p>
<br /><br /><b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
&gt; (guard (print "before ") (+ 3 "q") (print "after"))
before after
Error [5] : Numeric argument expected
Error object: "q"
Failed in: (+ 3 "q")
</pre>
