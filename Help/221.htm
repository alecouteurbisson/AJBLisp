<p>
List a directory.  Returns a list of filenames matching the
given path string which may have wildcard characters.

With a single argument, subdirectories are returned as sublists,
each containing a single directory name. If the second
boolean argument is true then all items are returned as
sublists with the following structure:
(name attrib created accessed modified).

Attrib is a string of the form "drhsa" with active attributes
capitalised.  E.g. a readonly directory would return "DRhsa".
created, accessed and modified are the file timestamps returned
as integer times.

the example below.
