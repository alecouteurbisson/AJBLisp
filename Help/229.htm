<h1><br /> (dump [&lt;more&gt;])</h1>
<b>Macro    </b><br />
<p>
Debug dump of heap. Probably best sent to a logfile for
detailed examination because the output will be very long.
</p><p>
Every heap object is dumped in a linear scan.
Any object reference not properly resolved in the heap or
object of zero length will be flagged with "### Error -"
</p><p>
Zero length objects will abort the dump since the offset to
the next real object is unknown.  dump returns the total
number of errors found.
</p><p>
If &lt;more&gt; is present and not null then add the addresses of
the car/cdr of cons nodes and the value/property of symbols to
the dump.  The dump cannot be fully understood without this
info but the shorter version is easier to scan for errors.
