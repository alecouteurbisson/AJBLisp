<h1><br /> (defconstant [&lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;]...)</h1>
<b>Macro    </b><br />
<p>
Define constants. If a symbol exists with the same name
then it will be converted and references to it will become
references to the constant.  Therefore, you may reference
a constant before it is defined.  You must, of course, ensure
that the constant is defined before it is used (dereferenced.)
</p><p>
Keys cannot be converted to constants and attempting to do so
will cause an error.  Converting a constant is legal and
re-assigns the constant value.  This is the only way to modify
a constant.

<br /><br /><b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
&gt; (defconstant :red   0xFF0000
               :green 0x00FF00
               :blue  0x0000FF)
= :blue
