<h1><br /> (defkey &lt;name&gt;...)</h1>
<b>Macro    </b><br />
<p>
Defines keys.  If a variable exists with the same name as any
argument then it will be destroyed and references to it will
become references to the key.
Therefore, you may reference a key before it is defined. You
must, of course, ensure that the key is defined before it is
used (dereferenced.)
</p><p>
Arguments may be keys, these are ignored. defkey returns its last
argument as a key. Constants may not be converted to keys.

<br /><br /><b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
&gt; (defkey :weekly :monthly :annual)
= :annual

&gt; :monthly
= :monthly
</pre>
