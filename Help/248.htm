<h1><br /> (gtextsize &lt;window&gt; &lt;text&gt;)</h1>
<b>Function </b><br />
<p>
Returns the width and height that the text would occupy
in the window if written with gtext.
</p><p>
These values are returned as (width height) where the
sizes are in pixels (note NOT viewport units.)
</p><p>
Text does not scale with the viewport so converting the
units from pixels would not really be useful.
