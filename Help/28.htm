<h1><br /> (slet ((&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;value&gt;) ...) &lt;body&gt; ...)</h1>
<b>Macro    </b><br />
<p>
Creates local variables.  The expressions in body are
evaluated in turn and the value of the last is returned.
The first argument is a list of variable bindings that exist
from their definition to the end of &lt;body&gt; ...
</p><p>
Each variable binding is itself a list of two items, a
symbol and an expression that is evaluated and initially
bound to the symbol. The bindings take place sequentially
and the &lt;value&gt; of any binding may refer to the local value
of any previously bound symbol.
<p>
<br /><br /><b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
&gt; (slet ((a 2) (b (* a 3)))
        (+ a b))
= 8
