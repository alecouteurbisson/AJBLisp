<h1><br /> (dst [&lt;on&gt;])</h1>
<b>Function </b><br />
<p>
Causes local times to be input/output with daylight savings time taken
into account if &lt;on&gt; is true.  This setting has no effect if UTC mode
has been set with (local-time nil). With no argument dst returns the
current setting without changing it.  Dst dates are provided by Windows
and are therefore unaffected by tzset.
