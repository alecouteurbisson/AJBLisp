<h1><br /> (file-position &lt;file&gt; [&lt;integer&gt; [&lt;key&gt;]])</h1>
<b>Function </b><br />
<p>
Get or set the position of a file pointer.  The first
argument is always a file.  If this is the only argument
then the file pointer is returned as an integer.
</p><p>
If the file is followed by an integer then the file pointer
is set accordingly.  An optional third argument is a key
which may be :seek-relative, :seek-start or :seek-end which
treats the integer value as an offset from the current
location, the start (default) or the end of the file
respectively.
