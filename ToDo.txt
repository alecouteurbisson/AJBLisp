Literal vectors should be immutable
Otherwise this code self-modifies!

(for (k 1 2)
     (let ((v #(a b c d)))
          (if (eq (vref v 2) 'c)
              (vset v 2 'x)
              (error 1 v "V changed") )))

Could introduce a constant vector type
This could be an almost invisible change which is
only apparent when an attempt is made to modify
an instance.

Some form of (catch :all) might be useful
